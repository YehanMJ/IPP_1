 The E-Commerce Store project is a full-stack web application built using React.js for the frontend,
 Express.js for the backend, and MySQL for data storage. It simulates an online shopping experience
 where users can browse products, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage their accounts.
 Admins can manage products, view orders, and handle users.
